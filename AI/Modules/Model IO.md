The core element of any language model application is...the model. LangChain gives you the building blocks to interface with any language model.

- [Prompts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/): Templatize, dynamically select, and manage model inputs
- [Chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/chat/): Models that are backed by a language model but take a list of Chat Messages as input and return a Chat Message
- [LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/llms/): Models that take a text string as input and return a text string
- [Output parsers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/): Extract information from model outputs
