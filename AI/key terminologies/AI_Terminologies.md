### LLM
**LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**. It is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate and predict new content. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks ยน.

LLM are machine learning models that are really good at understanding and generating human language they are based on transformers, a type of neural network architecture invented by Google. 
What made transformer so powerful, was its ability to scale effectively, allowing us to train on these models on massive text data sets. 
That's where the large in large language models comes from. Both the size and complexity of the neural network itself, as well as the size of dataset that it was trained on.
Once the researches started to make these models really really large and train them on the huge datasets. that they started showing the impressive results like understanding complex neurons language and generating language more understanding than ever.

Example : Training a model for a specific task like, is this tweet positive or negative

LLM stands for Language Model (LM), which is a type of machine learning model that focuses on understanding and generating human language. Language models are designed to process and generate text, enabling applications such as chatbots, language translation, text summarization, and more. Here are some examples of language models:

Examples of LLM
1. OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): GPT-3 (and its predecessor GPT-2) is a widely known **language model developed by OpenAI**. It uses a deep neural network architecture called a transformer and has been trained on a vast amount of text data. GPT-3 can generate coherent and contextually relevant text, answer questions, compose essays, and perform language-based tasks with remarkable fluency.
2. Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): BERT is a powerful language model developed by Google. It is pre-trained on a large corpus of text and can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. BERT excels at understanding the context of words and sentences, enabling more accurate language understanding and sentiment analysis.
3. GROVER: GROVER is a language model developed by the Allen Institute for AI. It is specifically designed to detect and generate fake news and propaganda. GROVER is trained on a large dataset of news articles and can distinguish between genuine and generated text, helping to combat misinformation.
