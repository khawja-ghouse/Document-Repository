"LLM" stands for "Large Language Model." LLMs refer to a category of advanced natural language processing (NLP) models characterized by their significant size, complexity, and **ability to process and generate human-like text**. These models are designed to understand, generate, and process natural language in various forms, performing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.

Key features and characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs) include:
1. **Scale:** LLMs have an extensive number of parameters, sometimes ranging from hundreds of millions to billions or even trillions of parameters. This large parameter count contributes to their ability to capture complex linguistic patterns.
2. **Pre-trained on Vast Datasets:** LLMs are typically pre-trained on massive amounts of text data from diverse sources on the internet. This pre-training allows them to learn language representations and patterns from a broad range of contexts and domains.
3. **Transformer Architecture:** Most LLMs are built on transformer architectures, which excel in capturing long-range dependencies in sequences and have revolutionized the field of NLP due to their ability to learn contextual information effectively.

Examples of well-known Large Language Models include:

- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series by OpenAI:** GPT-3, GPT-2, etc.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google:** Including variants like RoBERTa, DistilBERT, etc.
- **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) by Google Research:** Known for its text-to-text framework for various NLP tasks.
