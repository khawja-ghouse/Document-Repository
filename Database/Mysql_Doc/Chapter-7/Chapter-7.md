So far we have worked with simple data but the real world data is messy and interrelated. In the next couple of sections, we will be talking about how to work with interconnected data.

We will start with different ways in which data can be related. So far our queries were applied to only one particular table, next we will writing queries which can enable us dealing with multiple tables at the same time. We will also see how to link tables with foreign keys.

With joins we will be able to link two or more tables and show all related data together.

Types of Data Relationships

Now we have 3 different kinds of relationships in mysql, those are

1.     one to one (ex : a person can have only one information ; one to one relation is not    common and rare to find)
2.     one to many (one book can have many reviews)
3.     many to many (one book can have many authors and one author can have many books so   many authors can have many books)
