### What Are Java Design Patterns?

Design patterns in Java are **proven solutions to common software design problems**. They are like reusable blueprints for solving recurring challenges in software architecture. Rather than reinventing the wheel, developers can use design patterns to write well-structured, maintainable, and scalable code.

### Why Use Design Patterns?

1. **Reusability**:
    - Patterns promote code reuse, reducing duplication and redundancy.
2. **Scalability**:
    - Patterns provide frameworks for building systems that can grow without becoming overly complex.
3. **Maintainability**:
    - Patterns organize code into a clear and consistent structure, making it easier to understand, debug, and modify.
4. **Best Practices**:
    - They encapsulate industry-proven techniques for solving software design challenges.

### Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are categorized into **three main groups**: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**. Additionally, there are patterns specific to certain domains, like **Concurrency Patterns**.

---

#### 1. **Creational Design Patterns**

- **Focus**: How objects are created.
- **Goal**: Ensure the creation process is flexible and reusable.
- **Examples**:
    1. **Singleton**:
        - Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
        - Example: Managing a single database connection instance.
    2. **Factory Method**:
        - Delegates the creation of objects to subclasses.
        - Example: Creating objects without exposing the instantiation logic.
    3. **Abstract Factory**:
        - Produces families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
        - Example: UI toolkits like Windows, MacOS themes.
    4. **Builder**:
        - Constructs complex objects step by step.
        - Example: Constructing a `Car` object with optional features.
    5. **Prototype**:
        - Creates new objects by copying existing objects.
        - Example: Cloning objects in games (like game characters).

#### 2. **Structural Design Patterns**

- **Focus**: How classes and objects are composed.
- **Goal**: Ensure that different parts of a system work together efficiently.
- **Examples**:
    1. **Adapter**:
        - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
        - Example: Adapting a `USB` device to a `TypeC` port.
    2. **Decorator**:
        - Adds responsibilities dynamically to objects without altering their code.
        - Example: Adding toppings to a pizza object at runtime.
    3. **Proxy**:
        - Controls access to an object.
        - Example: Lazy loading, security proxies.
    4. **Bridge**:
        - Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.
        - Example: Separating the UI interface from rendering logic.
    5. **Composite**:
        - Treats individual objects and composites (groups) uniformly.
        - Example: File systems where files and directories are handled similarly.
    6. **Facade**:
        - Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
        - Example: A single entry point for multiple subsystems in a library.
    7. **Flyweight**:
        - Reuses fine-grained objects to save memory.
        - Example: Sharing icons in a text editor.

#### 3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

- **Focus**: How objects interact and communicate.
- **Goal**: Define ways for objects to collaborate without being tightly coupled.
- **Examples**:
    1. **Strategy**:
        - Encapsulates algorithms so they can be swapped.
        - Example: Sorting algorithms.
    2. **Observer**:
        - Notifies dependent objects of state changes.
        - Example: Event listeners.
    3. **Command**:
        - Encapsulates a request as an object.
        - Example: Undo and redo operations in text editors.
    4. **Template Method**:
        - Defines a skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to implement specifics.
        - Example: Workflow templates.
    5. **State**:
        - Changes the behavior of an object based on its state.
        - Example: A printer switching between "Idle," "Printing," and "Error" states.
    6. **Iterator**:
        - Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
        - Example: Iterating over a list or map.
    7. **Chain of Responsibility**:
        - Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
        - Example: Logging frameworks or middleware in web applications.
    8. **Mediator**:
        - Centralizes complex communications between objects.
        - Example: Chatroom where a mediator manages interactions between participants.
    9. **Visitor**:
        - Allows adding new operations to objects without changing them.
        - Example: Tax calculation for different product categories.

### Additional Patterns: Concurrency Patterns

- **Focus**: Multithreading and parallel processing.
- **Examples**:
    1. **Thread Pool**:
        - Manages a pool of reusable threads.
    2. **Future**:
        - Represents a placeholder for a result that will be available later.

### How to Choose the Right Design Pattern?

1. **Problem at Hand**:
    
    - Identify whether the issue is related to object creation, structure, or behavior.
2. **Simplicity**:
    
    - Avoid overcomplicating the design. Use patterns only when necessary.
3. **Scalability**:
    
    - Consider whether the chosen pattern will scale with your applicationâ€™s growth.

### Design Patterns in Java Libraries

- **Singleton**: `Runtime.getRuntime()`, `Logger`
- **Observer**: `EventListener` in Java Swing
- **Decorator**: `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
- **Factory**: `DocumentBuilderFactory`, `Calendar.getInstance()`
- **Strategy**: `Collections.sort()` with Comparator
