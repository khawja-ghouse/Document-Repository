# What is Adapter Design Pattern -:

**_Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and it is used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together._** It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. The pattern involves creating an adapter class that bridges the gap between the interfaces, allowing them to communicate effectively.

One real-world example of the **Adapter Design Pattern** is a mobile charger. Mobile chargers act as adapters between the power socket and the mobile device, converting the voltage to a suitable level for charging the device. In software development, the Adapter Design Pattern follows the same concept by introducing an additional adapter class between an existing interface and a class that needs to work with it.
