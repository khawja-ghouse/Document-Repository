### Factory Design Pattern Explanation with Example

The **Factory Design Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** used to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. Instead of directly instantiating a class with `new`, the Factory pattern uses a **factory method** to create objects.

---

### Key Features

1. **Encapsulation of Object Creation**:
    - The creation logic is encapsulated in a separate method or class, improving maintainability.
2. **Dynamic Object Creation**:
    - The pattern decides which class to instantiate at runtime based on some parameter.
3. **Flexibility**:
    - Adding new types of objects doesn't require modifying the client code, adhering to the **Open/Closed Principle**.

---

### When to Use?

- When the exact type of the object to create is determined at runtime.
- When object creation involves complex logic or configuration.

### Example: Factory Design Pattern

#### Scenario: Shape Factory

You want to create different types of shapes (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`) but donâ€™t want the client to directly use the constructors. Instead, a **ShapeFactory** will decide which shape to create based on a parameter.

---

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define an Interface** (or an Abstract Class): This will be the common type for all the objects created by the factory.
    
    ```java
    // Common Interface
    public interface Shape {
        void draw();
    }
    ```
    
2. **Implement the Interface**: Create concrete classes implementing the `Shape` interface.
    
    ```java
    // Concrete Classes
    public class Circle implements Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
        }
    }
    
    public class Rectangle implements Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a Rectangle");
        }
    }
    
    public class Square implements Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
        }
    }
    ```
    
3. **Create the Factory Class**: This class will contain a method to return the appropriate shape based on a parameter.
    
    ```java
    // Factory Class
    public class ShapeFactory {
        // Factory Method
        public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
            if (shapeType == null) {
                return null;
            }
            switch (shapeType.toUpperCase()) {
                case "CIRCLE":
                    return new Circle();
                case "RECTANGLE":
                    return new Rectangle();
                case "SQUARE":
                    return new Square();
                default:
                    return null;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
4. **Client Code**: The client uses the factory to create objects without knowing the exact class.
    
    ```java
    public class FactoryPatternExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Create a ShapeFactory instance
            ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
    
            // Get different shapes using the factory
            Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
            shape1.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Circle
    
            Shape shape2 = shapeFactory.getShape("RECTANGLE");
            shape2.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Rectangle
    
            Shape shape3 = shapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");
            shape3.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Square
        }
    }
    ```

### Advantages of Factory Pattern

1. **Encapsulation**:
    - Hides the instantiation logic from the client.
2. **Flexibility**:
    - Adding new shapes (e.g., `Triangle`) only requires modifying the factory, not the client.
3. **Loose Coupling**:
    - The client depends on an interface, not specific implementations.

---

### Disadvantages

1. **Complexity**:
    - Introduces additional classes and methods.
2. **Overhead**:
    - For very simple object creation, the pattern may add unnecessary complexity.

### Real-World Examples of Factory Pattern in Java

1. **JDBC**:
    - The `DriverManager.getConnection()` method acts as a factory to create database connections.
2. **`DocumentBuilderFactory`**:
    - Used to create `DocumentBuilder` objects in XML processing.
3. **Logging Frameworks**:
    - Factories are used to create different types of loggers (e.g., console, file).
