# What is Adapter Design Pattern -:

**_Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and it is used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together._** It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. The pattern involves creating an adapter class that bridges the gap between the interfaces, allowing them to communicate effectively.

One real-world example of the **Adapter Design Pattern** is a mobile charger. Mobile chargers act as adapters between the power socket and the mobile device, converting the voltage to a suitable level for charging the device. In software development, the Adapter Design Pattern follows the same concept by introducing an additional adapter class between an existing interface and a class that needs to work with it.

### Components of the Adapter Pattern

1. **Target Interface**: Defines the interface expected by the client.
2. **Client**: The class that uses the `Target` interface.
3. **Adaptee**: The existing class that needs to be adapted.
4. **Adapter**: A class that implements the `Target` interface and translates the requests from the client to the `Adaptee`.

### Example:

Student Interface
```java
package com.skg.patterns.structural.adapter;  
  
public interface Student {  
    public String getName();  
    public String getSurname();  
    public String getEmail();  
}
```

Student Implementation Class
```java
package com.skg.patterns.structural.adapter;  
  
public class CollageStudent implements  Student{  
  
    private String name;  
    private String surName;  
    private String email;  
  
    public CollageStudent(String email, String surName, String name) {  
        this.email = email;  
        this.surName = surName;  
        this.name = name;  
    }  
  
    public void setName(String name) {  
        this.name = name;  
    }  
  
    public void setSurName(String surName) {  
        this.surName = surName;  
    }  
  
    public void setEmail(String email) {  
        this.email = email;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String getName() {  
        return this.name;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String getSurname() {  
        return this.surName;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String getEmail() {  
        return this.email;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String toString() {  
        return "CollageStudent{" +  
                "name='" + name + '\'' +  
                ", surName='" + surName + '\'' +  
                ", email='" + email + '\'' +  
                '}';  
    }  
}
```

Non implementation class of Student Interface
```java
package com.skg.patterns.structural.adapter;  
  
public class SchoolStudent {  
  
    private String name;  
    private String surName;  
    private String email;  
  
    public SchoolStudent(String name, String surName, String email) {  
        this.name = name;  
        this.surName = surName;  
        this.email = email;  
    }  
  
    public void setName(String name) {  
        this.name = name;  
    }  
  
    public void setSurName(String surName) {  
        this.surName = surName;  
    }  
  
    public void setEmail(String email) {  
        this.email = email;  
    }  
  
    public String getName() {  
        return this.name;  
    }  
  
    public String getSurname() {  
        return this.surName;  
    }  
  
    public String getEmail() {  
        return this.email;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String toString() {  
        return "SchoolStudent{" +  
                "name='" + name + '\'' +  
                ", surName='" + surName + '\'' +  
                ", email='" + email + '\'' +  
                '}';  
    }  
}
```

### School Student Adapter 
```java
package com.skg.patterns.structural.adapter;  
  
public class SchoolStudentAdapter implements Student{  
  
    SchoolStudent schoolStudent;  
  
    public SchoolStudentAdapter(SchoolStudent schoolStudent){  
        this.schoolStudent = schoolStudent;  
    }  
  
  
    @Override  
    public String getName() {  
        return this.schoolStudent.getName();  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String getSurname() {  
        return this.schoolStudent.getSurname();  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String getEmail() {  
        return this.schoolStudent.getEmail();  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String toString() {  
        return "SchoolStudentAdapter{" +  
                "schoolStudent=" + schoolStudent +  
                '}';  
    }  
}
```

Student Client
```java
package com.skg.patterns.structural.adapter;  
  
import java.util.ArrayList;  
import java.util.List;  
  
public class StudentClient {  
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        List<Student> studentList = new ArrayList<>();  
  
        CollageStudent collageStudent = new CollageStudent("ghousekhawja@gmail.com","Ghouse","Khwaja");  
        studentList.add(collageStudent);  
  
        // Lets try to add school student also to the studentList  
        SchoolStudent schoolStudent = new SchoolStudent("Nadeem","Syed","syedNadeem@gmail.com");  
        // studentList.add(schoolStudent); // can't add this.  
  
        // We cannot do this because SchoolStudent is not implementing Student interface  
        // For this SchoolStudent to be added we need to create a Adapter class so that        // schoolStudent gets Adapted to Student interface.  
        studentList.add(new SchoolStudentAdapter(schoolStudent));  
  
        studentList.forEach(System.out::println);  
  
    }  
  
  
}
```
