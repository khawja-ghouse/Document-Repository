The **Decorator Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that dynamically adds new behavior or responsibilities to objects without altering their existing code. It is achieved by wrapping the original object with a "decorator" class that provides additional functionality.

---

### Key Concept

The Decorator pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Instead of modifying the base class or creating multiple subclasses, you "decorate" an object by wrapping it with one or more decorators.

---

### Components of the Decorator Pattern

1. **Component (Interface/Abstract Class)**: Defines the common interface for objects that can have responsibilities added dynamically.
2. **Concrete Component**: The original object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
3. **Decorator (Abstract Class)**: Maintains a reference to a `Component` object and defines an interface that conforms to `Component`.
4. **Concrete Decorators**: Extend the behavior of the `Component` by adding additional functionality.

---

### When to Use

- You need to add or modify behavior of objects at runtime.
- Subclassing is impractical because it leads to a large number of subclasses to cover every combination of behaviors.
- You want to follow the **Single Responsibility Principle**, separating concerns by creating multiple small classes.

### Example

#### Scenario: Coffee Shop Menu

You have a `Coffee` class, and you want to add optional behaviors like `Milk` or `Sugar` dynamically without modifying the base class or creating multiple subclasses for each combination.

#### Code Example

```java
// 1. Component
public interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}

// 2. Concrete Component
public class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return 5.0;
    }
}

// 3. Decorator
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected final Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost();
    }
}

// 4. Concrete Decorators
public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost() + 1.5;
    }
}

public class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost() + 0.5;
    }
}

// 5. Client
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " => Cost: " + coffee.getCost());

        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " => Cost: " + coffee.getCost());

        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " => Cost: " + coffee.getCost());
    }
}
```

---

### Output

```
Simple Coffee => Cost: 5.0
Simple Coffee, Milk => Cost: 6.5
Simple Coffee, Milk, Sugar => Cost: 7.0
```

---

### Advantages

1. **Flexible Extensibility**: Add functionality dynamically without modifying existing classes.
2. **Avoids Subclass Explosion**: Prevents the need for multiple subclasses to represent all combinations of features.
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: Extends behavior without changing the original class.

---

### Real-World Examples

1. **Java I/O Streams**: Classes like `BufferedReader` and `BufferedInputStream` decorate their base counterparts (`Reader` and `InputStream`).
2. **GUI Frameworks**: Adding scrollbars or borders to a window component dynamically.
3. **Spring Framework**: Bean post-processors and `ProxyFactoryBean` often use decorators to add cross-cutting concerns like logging and transactions.
