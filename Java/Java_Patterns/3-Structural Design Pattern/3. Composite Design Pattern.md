The **Composite Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly, enabling operations on both single and composite objects in the same way.

---
### Key Concept

The Composite pattern enables you to work with **leaf** nodes (individual objects) and **composite** nodes (groups of objects) through a common interface, allowing recursive composition.

---

### Components of the Composite Pattern

1. **Component**: The common interface for all objects in the composition. It declares methods for managing child components and performing operations.
2. **Leaf**: Represents the individual objects in the composition. It does not contain child components.
3. **Composite**: Represents the complex components that may have children. It implements methods to add, remove, and manage child components.
4. **Client**: Interacts with objects through the `Component` interface without knowing if they are leaf or composite objects.

---

### When to Use
- You need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- You want clients to be able to treat individual objects and composites of objects uniformly.
- You need a structure where components can contain other components recursively.

### Code Example

```java
package com.journaldev.design.composite;

public interface Shape {
	public void draw(String fillColor);
}

// Triangle.Java
package com.journaldev.design.composite;

public class Triangle implements Shape {

	@Override
	public void draw(String fillColor) {
		System.out.println("Drawing Triangle with color "+fillColor);
	}

}

// Circle.java
package com.journaldev.design.composite;

public class Circle implements Shape {

	@Override
	public void draw(String fillColor) {
		System.out.println("Drawing Circle with color "+fillColor);
	}
}
```

## Composite Java
A composite object contains group of leaf objects and we should provide some helper methods to add or delete leafs from the group. We can also provide a method to remove all the elements from the group.Â `Drawing.java`


```java
package com.journaldev.design.composite;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Drawing implements Shape{

	//collection of Shapes
	private List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<Shape>();
	
	@Override
	public void draw(String fillColor) {
		for(Shape sh : shapes)
		{
			sh.draw(fillColor);
		}
	}
	
	//adding shape to drawing
	public void add(Shape s){
		this.shapes.add(s);
	}
	
	//removing shape from drawing
	public void remove(Shape s){
		shapes.remove(s);
	}
	
	//removing all the shapes
	public void clear(){
		System.out.println("Clearing all the shapes from drawing");
		this.shapes.clear();
	}
}

package com.journaldev.design.test;

import com.journaldev.design.composite.Circle;
import com.journaldev.design.composite.Drawing;
import com.journaldev.design.composite.Shape;
import com.journaldev.design.composite.Triangle;

public class TestCompositePattern {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Shape tri = new Triangle();
		Shape tri1 = new Triangle();
		Shape cir = new Circle();
		
		Drawing drawing = new Drawing();
		drawing.add(tri1);
		drawing.add(tri1);
		drawing.add(cir);
		
		drawing.draw("Red");
		
		drawing.clear();
		
		drawing.add(tri);
		drawing.add(cir);
		drawing.draw("Green");
	}
}
```

```
OUTPUT

Drawing Triangle with color Red
Drawing Triangle with color Red
Drawing Circle with color Red
Clearing all the shapes from drawing
Drawing Triangle with color Green
Drawing Circle with color Green
```

### Advantages
1. **Simplifies Client Code**: Treats leaf and composite objects uniformly.
2. **Supports Recursive Structures**: Ideal for tree-like hierarchies such as file systems or organization charts.
3. **Extensibility**: New leaf or composite types can be added without changing existing code.

---
### Disadvantages

1. **Overhead**: Managing the hierarchy and ensuring consistency can add complexity.
2. **Difficult Debugging**: Recursive structures may be harder to debug and maintain.

---
### Real-World Examples

1. **GUI Frameworks**: Widgets like buttons, panels, and windows can be treated as components in a composite structure.
2. **File Systems**: Files and directories are classic examples.
3. **Graphics Editors**: Shapes like circles and rectangles (leaves) and groups of shapes (composites).
