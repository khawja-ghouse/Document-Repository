The **Facade Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides a unified interface for easier access, making the subsystem easier to use.

---

### Key Concept

The Facade acts as a "front-facing" interface, shielding clients from the detailed implementation of subsystems. This promotes loose coupling between clients and the underlying system.

---

### Components of the Facade Pattern

1. **Facade**: The simplified interface or entry point that interacts with multiple subsystems.
2. **Subsystems**: The complex modules or classes with specific functionalities.
3. **Client**: The external code or user that interacts with the Facade.

---

### When to Use

- You have a complex system with multiple interdependent classes.
- You want to simplify the interface to improve usability.
- You want to decouple the client code from the subsystem, enabling better maintainability.

### Example

#### Scenario: Home Automation System

A home automation system has different components like lights, AC, and music. The Facade pattern can provide a single interface to manage these components.

#### Code Example

```java
// Subsystem 1: Lights
public class Lights {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Lights are ON");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Lights are OFF");
    }
}

// Subsystem 2: Air Conditioner
public class AirConditioner {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Air Conditioner is ON");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Air Conditioner is OFF");
    }

    public void setTemperature(int temperature) {
        System.out.println("Setting temperature to " + temperature + "°C");
    }
}

// Subsystem 3: Music System
public class MusicSystem {
    public void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Playing music");
    }

    public void stopMusic() {
        System.out.println("Music stopped");
    }
}

// Facade
public class HomeAutomationFacade {
    private final Lights lights;
    private final AirConditioner ac;
    private final MusicSystem music;

    public HomeAutomationFacade(Lights lights, AirConditioner ac, MusicSystem music) {
        this.lights = lights;
        this.ac = ac;
        this.music = music;
    }

    public void startMovieMode() {
        System.out.println("Starting Movie Mode...");
        lights.turnOff();
        ac.turnOn();
        ac.setTemperature(22);
        music.playMusic();
    }

    public void stopMovieMode() {
        System.out.println("Stopping Movie Mode...");
        lights.turnOn();
        ac.turnOff();
        music.stopMusic();
    }
}

// Client
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Lights lights = new Lights();
        AirConditioner ac = new AirConditioner();
        MusicSystem music = new MusicSystem();

        HomeAutomationFacade homeFacade = new HomeAutomationFacade(lights, ac, music);

        // Using Facade
        homeFacade.startMovieMode();
        homeFacade.stopMovieMode();
    }
}
```

---

### Output

```
Starting Movie Mode...
Lights are OFF
Air Conditioner is ON
Setting temperature to 22°C
Playing music
Stopping Movie Mode...
Lights are ON
Air Conditioner is OFF
Music stopped
```

---

### Advantages

1. **Simplifies Usage**: Provides a unified interface for complex subsystems.
2. **Loose Coupling**: Decouples clients from the subsystem implementation.
3. **Improves Maintainability**: Changes in the subsystem do not affect the client as long as the Facade interface remains consistent.

---

### Disadvantages

1. **Hides Fine-Grained Control**: Advanced functionality of subsystems might be unavailable through the Facade.
2. **Potential Overhead**: Additional abstraction can add complexity if not implemented correctly.

---

### Real-World Examples

1. **Database Access**: A single DAO class acts as a Facade for accessing multiple tables or operations.
2. **Java Logging**: The `java.util.logging` package acts as a Facade for logging frameworks.
3. **Spring Framework**: Spring provides Facades for managing configurations and accessing services.
