The **Mediator Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that facilitates communication between objects by using a mediator object. Instead of objects referring to each other directly, they communicate through the mediator, promoting loose coupling and centralizing the interaction logic.

---

### Key Concept

The Mediator pattern encapsulates how a set of objects interact, ensuring that these objects do not need to reference each other directly. This makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

---

### Components of the Mediator Pattern

1. **Mediator Interface**: Defines the contract for communication between Colleagues.
2. **Concrete Mediator**: Implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between Colleague objects.
3. **Colleague Interface**: Represents objects that communicate via the Mediator.
4. **Concrete Colleagues**: Implement the Colleague interface and interact through the Mediator.

---

### When to Use

- When multiple objects need to communicate but you want to avoid tight coupling between them.
- When interaction logic is complex and distributed across multiple objects, making the system harder to understand or maintain.
- To centralize control over communication in a system with multiple interacting components.

### Example

#### Scenario: Chat Room

A chat room allows users to send messages to one another. Instead of users communicating directly, a mediator (chat room) facilitates communication.

#### Code Example

```java
// Mediator Interface
public interface ChatMediator {
    void sendMessage(String message, User user);
    void addUser(User user);
}

// Concrete Mediator
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    private final List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, User user) {
        for (User u : users) {
            // Message should not be received by the user who sent it
            if (!u.equals(user)) {
                u.receiveMessage(message);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void addUser(User user) {
        users.add(user);
    }
}

// Colleague Interface
public abstract class User {
    protected ChatMediator mediator;
    protected String name;

    public User(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        this.mediator = mediator;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void sendMessage(String message);

    public abstract void receiveMessage(String message);
}

// Concrete Colleague
public class ChatUser extends User {
    public ChatUser(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        super(mediator, name);
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " sends: " + message);
        mediator.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void receiveMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " receives: " + message);
    }
}

// Client
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatMediator chatRoom = new ChatRoom();

        User user1 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "Alice");
        User user2 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "Bob");
        User user3 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "Charlie");
        User user4 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "Diana");

        chatRoom.addUser(user1);
        chatRoom.addUser(user2);
        chatRoom.addUser(user3);
        chatRoom.addUser(user4);

        user1.sendMessage("Hello, everyone!");
        user3.sendMessage("Hi Alice!");
    }
}
```

---

### Output

```
Alice sends: Hello, everyone!
Bob receives: Hello, everyone!
Charlie receives: Hello, everyone!
Diana receives: Hello, everyone!
Charlie sends: Hi Alice!
Alice receives: Hi Alice!
Bob receives: Hi Alice!
Diana receives: Hi Alice!
```

### Advantages

1. **Reduces Coupling**: Objects interact through the mediator, not directly with each other.
2. **Centralized Control**: Interaction logic is encapsulated in the mediator, simplifying maintenance.
3. **Improves Reusability**: Objects (Colleagues) are more reusable as they donâ€™t depend on other objects.

---

### Disadvantages

1. **Mediator Complexity**: The mediator can become complex as the number of interactions increases.
2. **Single Point of Failure**: The mediator is a critical component; its failure affects the entire system.

---

### Real-World Examples

1. **GUI Frameworks**: Dialog boxes that coordinate interactions between controls (e.g., buttons, text fields).
2. **Messaging Systems**: Systems like message brokers act as mediators between producers and consumers.
3. **Airport Control Tower**: Acts as a mediator between flights to manage air traffic.


In the chat room example, the Mediator (ChatRoom) solves the following issues:

1. **Tight Coupling Between Users**  
    Without a mediator, each user would need to maintain references to every other user to send messages. This results in a tightly coupled system where adding, removing, or updating a user affects all others.
    
    **Solved:**  
    Users communicate through the ChatRoom, which acts as a central hub. Users do not need to know about each other, reducing coupling.
    
2. **Complex Communication Logic**  
    If users were to communicate directly, each user would need logic to filter who should receive messages (e.g., exclude the sender). This logic would be duplicated across all users.
    
    **Solved:**  
    The ChatRoom encapsulates the communication logic, ensuring that messages are sent only to appropriate users. This keeps the individual User classes simpler.
    
3. **Scalability**  
    As the number of users grows, direct communication requires each user to maintain a larger list of peers, increasing memory usage and complexity.
    
    **Solved:**  
    The mediator handles all users dynamically. Adding or removing users does not affect the implementation of other users.
    
4. **Centralized Control**  
    Without a mediator, there is no single place to control or monitor message flow. Debugging or extending functionality (e.g., logging, filtering messages) becomes difficult.
    
    **Solved:**  
    The mediator serves as the single point of control, making it easier to manage the system and add new features (e.g., filtering offensive messages, logging communications).
    
5. **Dynamic User Management**  
    Without a mediator, dynamically adding or removing users would require updates to all existing users' references, making the system error-prone and hard to maintain.
    
    **Solved:**  
    The mediator manages the user list, making it easy to add or remove users at runtime.
