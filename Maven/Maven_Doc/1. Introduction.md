# What is a Build Tool?

A build tool is a tool that automates everything related to building a software project. Building a software project typically includes one or more of these activities:

- Generating source code (if auto-generated code is used in the project).
- Generating documentation from the source code.
- Compiling source code.
- Packaging compiled code into JAR files or ZIP files.
- Installing the packaged code on a server, in a repository, or somewhere else.

Any given software project may have more activities than those needed to build the finished software. Such activities can normally be plugged into a build tool so these activities can be automated too.

The advantage of automating the build process is minimizing the risk of **human errors while building the software manually**. Additionally, an automated build tool is typically faster than a human performing the same steps manually.

## Installing Maven

From this website, you can download the latest version of Maven and follow the project.
[http://maven.apache.org](http://maven.apache.org)


To install Maven on your system, follow these steps:

1. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to a valid Java SDK (e.g., Java 8).
2. Download and unzip Maven.
3. Set the `M2_HOME` environment variable to point to the directory where Maven is unzipped.
4. Set the `M2` environment variable to point to `M2_HOME/bin` (`%M2_HOME%\bin` on Windows, `$M2_HOME/bin` on Unix).
5. Add `M2` to the `PATH` environment variable (`%M2%` on Windows, `$M2` on Unix).
6. Open a command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   mvn -version
   ```
   This command should display Maven's version if installed correctly.

> **Note**: Maven uses Java during execution, so ensure Java is installed and `JAVA_HOME` is set as explained above.
