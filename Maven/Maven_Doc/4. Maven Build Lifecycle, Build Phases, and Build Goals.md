# Maven Build Lifecycle, Build Phases, and Build Goals

Maven is a powerful build tool in the Java ecosystem, structured around the concept of a **build lifecycle**. This lifecycle is a sequence of steps (phases) Maven follows to build and manage projects. Understanding the lifecycle, its phases, and goals helps developers efficiently manage their projects.

## **1. Maven Build Lifecycle**

The **Maven Build Lifecycle** consists of a series of ordered phases. When you execute a command, Maven processes these phases sequentially, starting from the first until the specified phase is completed.

### **Types of Build Lifecycles**
1. **Default Lifecycle** (build):
   - Handles project deployment.
2. **Clean Lifecycle**:
   - Handles project cleaning.
3. **Site Lifecycle**:
   - Handles the creation of project documentation.

Each lifecycle consists of specific phases, which in turn execute goals.

## **2. Build Phases**

A **build phase** represents a stage in the lifecycle. Executing a phase automatically executes all the preceding phases.

### **Phases in the Default Lifecycle**
1. **validate**:
   - Validates the project is correct and all required information is available.
2. **compile**:
   - Compiles the source code of the project.
3. **test**:
   - Runs unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit.
4. **package**:
   - Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
5. **verify**:
   - Runs checks to verify the package meets quality criteria.
6. **install**:
   - Installs the package into the local repository for use in other projects.
7. **deploy**:
   - Copies the final package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers.

### **Phases in the Clean Lifecycle**
1. **pre-clean**:
   - Performs tasks before cleaning.
2. **clean**:
   - Removes files generated by the previous build.
3. **post-clean**:
   - Performs tasks after cleaning.

### **Phases in the Site Lifecycle**
1. **pre-site**:
   - Performs tasks before generating site documentation.
2. **site**:
   - Generates project documentation.
3. **post-site**:
   - Performs tasks after generating site documentation.
4. **site-deploy**:
   - Deploys the generated site documentation.

## **3. Build Goals**

A **build goal** is a task that Maven executes as part of a build phase. Goals are typically provided by Maven plugins and can be executed directly or as part of a phase.

### **Examples of Build Goals**
- `compile`: Compiles the source code.
- `test`: Runs unit tests.
- `clean`: Deletes files from the `target` directory.
- `package`: Packages the project into a JAR or WAR file.
- `install`: Installs the packaged artifact into the local repository.

### **Binding of Goals to Phases**
In Maven, goals are bound to specific phases. For example:
- The `compile` goal is bound to the `compile` phase.
- The `jar:jar` goal is bound to the `package` phase.

You can also execute goals directly by specifying them in Maven commands:
```bash
mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn package
```

## **4. Executing Maven Phases and Goals**

When you run a Maven command, you specify either a phase or a goal:

### **Example Commands**
1. Execute a specific phase:
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```
   This runs all phases up to and including `package`.

2. Execute a specific goal:
   ```bash
   mvn dependency:tree
   ```
   This directly runs the `dependency:tree` goal without running the lifecycle.
