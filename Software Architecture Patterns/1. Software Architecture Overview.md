### What is Software Architecture?

Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a software system. It encompasses the decisions about the organization, design, and interactions between components to meet technical and business requirements. It focuses on system qualities like scalability, performance, security, and maintainability.

### Evolution of Software Architecture

#### 1. **Monolithic Architecture**

- **Description**:
    - A single-tiered application where all components (UI, business logic, database access) are combined into one program.
- **Advantages**:
    - Simple development and deployment.
    - Easier to debug due to centralized codebase.
- **Challenges**:
    - Scalability is vertical (adding resources to a single server).
    - Difficult to maintain and update as the codebase grows.
    - Single point of failure.

#### 2. **Layered Architecture**

- **Description**:
    - Divides the application into layers like Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access.
- **Advantages**:
    - Separation of concerns.
    - Better maintainability compared to monolithic architecture.
- **Challenges**:
    - Can still be a monolith if all layers are tightly coupled.

#### 3. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

- **Description**:
    - Components are structured as services that communicate over a network.
- **Advantages**:
    - Reusable and loosely coupled services.
    - Facilitates integration between different applications.
- **Challenges**:
    - Complexity in managing services.
    - Heavy reliance on middleware like ESBs (Enterprise Service Bus).

#### 4. **Microservices Architecture**

- **Description**:
    - Applications are broken into smaller, independently deployable services.
- **Advantages**:
    - High scalability and fault tolerance.
    - Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    - Supports modern deployment practices like CI/CD.
- **Challenges**:
    - Requires a robust DevOps culture.
    - Distributed systems bring complexity (e.g., data consistency, communication).

#### 5. **Serverless Architecture**

- **Description**:
    - Applications run in the cloud, and developers focus only on writing functions.
- **Advantages**:
    - No infrastructure management.
    - Pay-per-use model reduces costs.
- **Challenges**:
    - Vendor lock-in.
    - Limited control over the execution environment.
