### Layered Architecture (N-Tier Architecture)

#### 1. **Definition**

Layered architecture organizes an application into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility. These layers communicate with one another in a defined sequence, promoting separation of concerns and modularity.

#### 2. **Typical Layers**

1. **Presentation Layer (UI Layer)**:

    - Handles user interface and interaction.
    - Communicates with the business layer to fetch and display data.
2. **Business Logic Layer**:
    
    - Contains the core logic and rules of the application.
    - Processes user requests and enforces business rules.
    - Interacts with the data layer for persistence or retrieval.
3. **Data Access Layer**:
    
    - Manages database operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    - Encapsulates the logic for data access, ensuring consistency and security.
4. **Database Layer** (sometimes combined with Data Access Layer):
    
    - Stores the application's data.

#### 3. **Characteristics**

- **Hierarchical Communication**:
    - Layers communicate in a top-down or bottom-up manner (e.g., Presentation ↔ Business ↔ Data).
- **Loose Coupling**:
    - Each layer focuses on a specific aspect, reducing dependency.
- **Code Reusability**:
    - Logic is modular, allowing for reuse in different parts of the application.

#### 4. **Advantages**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
    
    - Each layer has a well-defined responsibility, improving maintainability and readability.
2. **Scalability**:
    
    - Logical separation allows for individual scaling of layers, e.g., caching in the data layer or load balancers for the presentation layer.
3. **Ease of Testing**:
    
    - Layers can be tested independently.
4. **Modularity**:
    
    - Changes in one layer typically do not affect others, provided interfaces are maintained.
5. **Team Collaboration**:
    
    - Teams can work on different layers in parallel.

#### 5. **Disadvantages**

1. **Performance Overhead**:
    
    - Sequential communication between layers can lead to latency.
2. **Tight Layer Dependency**:
    
    - Layers can become tightly coupled if designed poorly, leading to a pseudo-monolithic structure.
3. **Complexity in Larger Applications**:
    
    - As the application grows, managing dependencies and logic across layers can become challenging.

#### 6. **Use Cases**

- **Enterprise Applications**:
    - Systems with well-defined user interaction, logic, and data storage layers.
- **Standard Web Applications**:
    - Websites or portals with clear separation of UI, logic, and database operations.
- **E-Commerce Platforms**:
    - Applications where shopping cart (business logic), product database (data layer), and user interfaces (presentation) are modularized.

#### 7. **Example**

**Banking Application with Layers**:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
    - Web or mobile interface where users check balances or transfer funds.
2. **Business Logic Layer**:
    - Rules like “cannot transfer more than account balance.”
3. **Data Access Layer**:
    - SQL queries or APIs to fetch and update account details in the database.
4. **Database Layer**:
    - Tables for storing user accounts, transactions, and logs.

#### 8. **Comparison with Monolithic Architecture**

While monolithic architecture bundles everything together, layered architecture provides logical separation within the monolith. However, it does not inherently solve issues like scaling or deployment complexities that arise in monoliths.
